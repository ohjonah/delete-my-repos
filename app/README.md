# Things I've learned:

-   Libraries: React, TailwindCSS, Firebase Auth
-   React: Hooks / Reducers / Context / React-Router-Dom
-   Deploying through Netlify
-   Minimal Webpack with SVG support
-   Consuming data from an api
-   Protected Routes using `react-router-dom`
-   Implementing a table with sorting capabilities for data
-   Thinking through API calls for minimal read/write
-   Firebase security
-   Optimizing my bundle

# USER FLOW

1. User is authorized by Github OAuth
2. User is routed to dashboard.
3. User is shown table of repos with relevant information (i.e. repo creation date, last commit, number of collaborators, etc.)
4. User can select a number of repos.
5. Delete button is enabled.
6. Compiled repos is shown (List Review?) before deletion.
7. Delete.
8. Additional Instruction Page after deletion to delete more or delete account.
